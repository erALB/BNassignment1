    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. It is a very fast paced sport that requires great reflexes, 
        agility and motor coordination in order to compete at the highest levels. </p>
    <p>Fun fact: The name is derived from Badminton House, itself named after a village in Gloucestershire, England, where the sport was commonly played by the guests of the Duke of Beaufort.</p>
